# JavaScript-Projects
Simple projects made using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

## Calculator
A fully working simplistic calculator. I decided to go for a classic design approach with the font and colour schemes.

*hint: enter 543974 (skepta) for a hidden feature!!*

## Simple drop-down
A very simplistic HTML page with a drop-down menu created using JavaScript.

This simply works by calling the below function `onmouseenter` to show the hidden element:

```
function dropDown(dropDown) {
            document.getElementById(dropDown).style.visibility = "visible";
        }
```
